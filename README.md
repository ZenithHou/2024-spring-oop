# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Homework Repository

## Welcome to My OOP Learning Journey

This repository is a meticulous compilation of my homework submissions and learnings as I delve into Object-Oriented Programming. Through this journey, I'm exploring the intricacies of OOP using C++, focusing on concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. Each piece of homework is an incremental step in mastering these concepts, structured to facilitate both learning and teaching.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into sequential folders representing each homework assignment undertaken in my learning path. Here's how it's structured:

- **Homework Folders (`01`, `02`, `03`, etc.)**: Each top-level folder represents a set of homework assignments. The folders are sequentially numbered according to the order of assignments.

  - **Subdirectories (`1-1`, `1-2`, `1-3`, etc.)**: Within each homework folder, subdirectories are named following the format `{HW#}-{Part#}` to represent different parts or questions of that homework. This structure allows for an organized approach to tackling various aspects of OOP.
  
- **Contents of Each Submission**:
  - `.cpp` files: Contain the C++ source code for the assignment.
  - `.h` files: Header files accompanying `.cpp` files, containing class definitions and function prototypes.
  - `Makefile`: Scripts to automate the compilation of code, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly compiled into the final executable.
  - Output files: Provided by the Online Judge (OJ) platform, these files contain expected outputs for testing and verifying the correctness of the code.

### Navigating the Repository

- **Sequential Learning**: For newcomers or fellow learners, it's recommended to go through the homework folders sequentially to grasp the evolving complexity of OOP concepts.

- **Compilation and Execution**: Each assignment can be compiled and executed by navigating to its respective directory and using the provided `Makefile`. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

- **Output Validation**: Use the provided output files to compare and validate the results of your program executions against expected outcomes.

### Disclaimer

This repository serves as a documentation of my personal learning journey in OOP. It is intended for educational purposes only and as a means to share knowledge with others who might be on a similar path.

### Feedback and Contributions

I invite feedback, discussion, and contributions from anyone looking to improve or learn alongside me. Whether it's suggesting refactorings, discussing OOP concepts, or sharing learning resources, feel free to reach out or open an issue/pull request.

**Happy Coding!**
